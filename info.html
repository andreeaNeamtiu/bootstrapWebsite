          <h5 class="card-title">An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near
            future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or
            endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into
            consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of
            such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to NatureServe's global conservation status,
            approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants,
            and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[13]:415 Thus, in total, between seven and
            eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[13]:416 This total
            is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species
            Act.</p>

        <h5 class="card-header text-white ">Do not feed the animals</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">The prohibition "do not feed the animals" reflects a policy forbidding the artificial
            feeding of wildlife (wild or feral animals) in situations where the animals, or the people doing the feeding,
            might be harmed.</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Signs displaying this message are commonly found in zoos, circuses, animal theme parks,
            aquariums, national parks, parks, public spaces, farms, and other places where people come into contact with
            wildlife.[4][5][6] In some cases there are laws to enforce such no-feeding policies.[7][8] However, some
            people (such as some of those who enjoy feeding pigeons in cities) openly and strongly oppose such laws
            claiming that animals such as pigeons can be an amenity for people who do not have company such as friends or
            family, and say that the laws prohibiting feeding animals in urban places must change.[9] In some countries,
            such as Greece, feeding the pigeons in cities is a widespread practice.[10] Cultural hostility to feeding
            animals in cities and laws that ban the practice raise concerns about how humans relate to other living beings
            in the urban environment.[11] Politicians have also protested laws that ban feeding feral pigeons in
            cities.[11] Feral pigeons in cities existed for thousands of years but only recently in some countries humans
            started seeing them as a nuisance and became hostile to them.[12] In India, feeding feral animals in cities is
            considered a noble act.[13] Academicians say that how humans treat animals is related to how humans treat each
            other and thus raise concerns about the cultural shift from seeing feral city pigeons as harmless in the 1800s
            to seeing them an undesirable in some countries in the 2000s.</p>

        <h5 class="card-header text-white">Marine mammal</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Marine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean and other marine ecosystems for
            their existence. </h5>
          <p class="card-text">They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They are
            an informal group, unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding and survival.
            Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and
            sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic;
            they spend the majority of their time in the water but need to return to land for important activities such as
            mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic
            living. The diets of marine mammals vary considerably as well; some eat zooplankton, others eat fish, squid,
            shellfish, or sea-grass, and a few eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to
            those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of
            marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining
            ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.</p>

        <h5 class="card-header text-white">Animal navigation</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Animal navigation is the ability of many animals to find their way accurately without
            maps or instruments.</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the
            salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds,[1] and many other species
            navigate effectively over shorter distances.
            Dead reckoning, navigating from a known position using only information about one's own speed and direction,
            was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 as a possible mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed
            that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's
            magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing
            pigeons could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field,
            olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient
            itself and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were
            visible.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">EUROPE</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Eurasian Lynx
            The Eurasian lynx lives in Scandinavia, northern Europe, and parts of Asia. It was nearly extirpated from much
            of Europe during the 19th Century, like many other animals, but is being reintroduced to the region.

            Reindeer
            Reindeer (also known as caribou in North America) live in Russia and Scandinavia. When they’re not figuring
            who will steer Santa’s sleigh, reindeer migrate in herds to the north during the summer and to the south in
            the winter, sometimes traveling more than 500 miles.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">AFRICA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Lions
            The “king of the jungle” is on everyone’s must-see list. Simba and his family live in the grasslands and
            savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa. Head to Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, or South Africa to see these majestic
            creatures.
            African Elephant
            As the largest land animal on the earth, an elephant won’t be hard to miss! African elephants grow to about 13
            feet tall and weigh thousands of pounds. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, and they use them
            to dig for food. They live in the same area as lions – sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">ANTARCTICA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Penguins
            The Arctic may have polar bears, but Antarctica has penguins! There are seven types of penguins that live on
            or near Antarctica, including the largest penguin the Emperor. Though penguins don’t fly through the air, they
            do soar under water at up to 25 mph.
            Seals
            There are four types of seals found in Antarctica. Without polar bears hunting them, these seals are much less
            skittish around people. Seals look cute but can be aggressive hunters – leopard seals prey on smaller seals
            and even penguins.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">ASIA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Proboscis Monkey
            If you’re trying to spot a proboscis monkey, just look for the long nose! Like the name suggests, these
            monkeys are known for their noses as well as red fur. They live in Borneo and spend most of their time in the
            trees, except for the occasional belly flops into water.

            Giant Panda
            Tucked in the mountains of central China, giant pandas are one of the most well-known bears that live in Asia.
            (There are also sun bears, sloth bears, and Asian black bears.) There are only around 1000 of these shy
            animals in the wild, and giant pandas are on the endangered species list.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">AUSTRALIA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Kangaroo
            No trip down under would be complete without seeing a kangaroo! These marsupials have strong hind legs, and
            gray kangaroos can hop over 35 miles per hour. A newborn kangaroo is tiny (think: size of a cherry) and
            immediately climbs into its mother’s pouch where it stays for 10-11 months before emerging.

            Koala
            Though a koala is often called a koala bear, it actually is not a bear at all! Like kangaroos, koalas are
            marsupials. These cute creatures live in eastern Australia and sleep up to 18 hours a day – talk about
            #napgoals.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">NORTH AMERICA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            American Bison
            Often mistakenly called a buffalo, American bison used to live in massive herds across the grasslands of North
            America. Now these huge animals live in national parks and reserves, including Yellowstone National Park.
            Grey Wolf
            The grey wolf is the largest feral member of the canine family. Wolves were misunderstood to be evil and were
            hunted unfairly (and even exterminated from Great Britain). Conservation efforts have helped restore the wolf
            population, and they can be found in northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin, western Montana, northwestern
            Wyoming, and northern Idaho.
          </p>
          <h5 class="card-title">SOUTH AMERICA</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Llama
            While llama is the general name used for lamoids, there are actually four types in South America: vicuna,
            guanaco, alpaca, and the domestic llama. Llamas are pack animals, and native people use them to transport
            goods throughout the region. But be warned – an overloaded or cranky llama will spit!

            Sloth
            Sloths live in the jungles of Central and South America. They are extremely slow-moving—topping out at 0.15
            mph—and algae grows on their coats as a result. Sloths spend most of their lives living in the trees, but they
            are also good swimmers.</p>
